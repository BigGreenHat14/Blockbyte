# Blockbyte
My version of BlockBit for Scratch


(Scratch is a project of the Scratch Foundation, in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at [https://scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu))

# Setup
1. Download the repository at `https://github.com/BigGreenHat14/Blockbyte/archive/refs/heads/main.zip`
2. Extract the zip file
3. `cd` into the extracted zip
4. Configure the `.env` file for the account the server will use 
5. Run `python main.py -p id` to start the server (where python is your python executable and id is the project id of your remix)
6. Configure `restart_blockbyte.bat` (Windows) or `restart_blockbyte.sh` (Unix) files

**If you need to, [create a venv](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_virtualenv.asp)**

Bonus:
Run `python main.py -m` to start the menu (where python is your python executable)

If this doesn't work create an issue and i might help
